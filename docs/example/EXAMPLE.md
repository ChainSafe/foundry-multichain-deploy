# Example

> **WARNING**: 
> 
> This folder can be copied as-is to another location and you can work on it. Make sure you don't work on this folder *here*. To help you, there's a `just copy-example` command *in the root level of this project* that does all this for you.

This example uses the starter Foundry contract and shows you how you can deploy
it using the adapter.

Ignore the code in `src` and focus on the `script/` folder. Ensure that you've
set the `PRIVATE_KEY` and `CHAIN_RPC_URL` variables in the `.env` file, and run
`just deploy`.

If you want to do these yourself, make sure you set these environment variables
in your shell, or load the dotenv file appropriately.
