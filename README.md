# foundry-multichain-deploy (powered by Sygma)

> **Warning**
>
> Only testnet multichain deployment is available. Mainnet deployment will be enabled soon!

Provides `foundry` tooling for deploying contracts on multiple chains in a single ttransaction
and providing identical address on each chain.
See
[ChainSafe/hardhat-plugin-multichain-deploy]("https://github.com/ChainSafe/hardhat-plugin-multichain-deploy")
for the Hardhat plugin version.

The plugin uses [Sygma protocol](https://buildwithsygma.com/) and [CreateX](https://github.com/pcaversaccio/createx) to execute deployments. You can find the list of supported networks [here](https://docs.buildwithsygma.com/environments).

Check the [Documentation](./docs/DOCUMENTATION.md) for instructions on installation, usage (with an example project) and development.
